      <div style="width: auto;"><p>Every journey begins with a single step, and my academic path in Information Technology started in 2021 at AMA Computer College. With a background in TVL-ICT-Animation from senior high, I was eager to expand my knowledge beyond design and animation, diving deeper into programming, databases, and networking. Throughout my college years, I embraced opportunities that allowed me to grow both academically and professionally—taking on a commission-based role as a digital illustrator, leading technical seminars, and pushing the boundaries of AI-driven innovation through our thesis project. These experiences culminated in my on-the-job training at Zamperla Asia Pacific, where I applied my skills in a real-world IT environment. Looking back, my journey was filled with challenges, achievements, and invaluable lessons that shaped me into the professional I am today.</p>      </div>

      <h3>4th Year - Internship at Zamperla</h3>
      <div style="padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">
        <p>My On-the-Job Training (OJT) at Zamperla Asia Pacific was an invaluable experience that helped me grow professionally and personally. It provided me with hands-on exposure to various IT-related tasks, troubleshooting challenges, and workplace dynamics. Throughout my OJT, I worked on multiple projects, assisted with technical issues, and even had memorable moments with my colleagues.</p><br>

        <p>I officially started my OJT on September 30, 2024 by submitting my requirements and diving straight into work. My first task involved installing CCTV cameras, taking screenshots of installed applications on all employee computers, uninstalling unnecessary applications, and setting up a face recognition biometric system. This initial experience set the tone for my entire training—hands-on, fast-paced, and full of learning opportunities.</p><br>

        <p>Over the next few months, I took on a wide range of responsibilities. Here are some of the highlights:</p><br>
        <p><b>System and Network Maintenance</b></p>
        <p>
          - Set up and tested VPN accounts.<br>
          - Worked on printer configurations and network printers, including FujiFilm printer's accounting system.<br>
          - Assisted in setting up telephone lines.<br>
          - Worked on domain connectivity issues and reconnected multiple devices to the domain.<br>
          - Fixed network connectivity issues and ensuring stable internet connectivity.<br>
          - Assisted in giving employees voucher codes for limited Wi-Fi usage with WatchGuard Fireware.<br>
          </p><br>
        <p><b>Software</b></p>
        <p>
          - Installed and configured various applications for different departments.<br>
          - Troubleshoot Windows Update problems.<br>
          - Microsoft Office suite-related issues, and many more.<br>
          - Assisted employees in setting up projection for the dual monitor and projector.<br>
          - Assisted in setting up accounts for new employees.<br>
          - Conducted email backups and storage management for better efficiency.<br>
          </p><br>
        <p><b>Hardware</b></p>
        <p>
          - Built and set up new desktops and laptops for employees. <br>
          - Organized and managed cables for better workstation setups. <br>
          - Assisted in configuring dual monitors and domain reconnections. <br>
          - Conducted preventive maintenance on IT equipment. <br>
          - Set up conference room equipment, such as TVs, and projectors. <br>
          </p><br>
        <p><b>Special Projects</b></p>
        <p>
          - Helped set up biometric systems for employee attendance tracking. <br>
          - Assisted in setting up VR equipment and testing rides at Skyranch. <br>
          - Guided work immersion students: introduced them to what being in IT is, taught them programming from HTML to CSS, some JavaScript and PHP, and supported them throughout their entire work immersion at Zamperla. <br>
          </p><br>
        
        <p>There were several instances where I faced unexpected challenges. For example, I mistakenly disconnected a laptop from the domain and logged in as a normal user instead of an administrator. The laptop got locked out; there were only 2 fixes for this: either we find the password or reset the laptop. I helped my supervisor with this and found a better way to bypass it. This taught me the importance of verifying each step before working with sensitive stuff or anything I work with and the importance of playing as a team; suggesting other ways toward a goal helps the efficiency of the work. I also encountered difficulties in troubleshooting printer networks, but with persistence and guidance from my supervisor, I was able to resolve them.        </p>
        <br>
        <p>My OJT was not just about technical work; it also had its fair share of fun and memorable experiences:</p>
        <p>
          - Going to Skyranch as part of the job.<br>
          - The "awkward going home" incident where HR asked me to return made for a good laugh later.<br>
          - The super early morning arrivals, occasional late days, and the funny moments with colleagues.<br>
          - The teamwork and camaraderie during the Christmas party—I just sat there, but I enjoyed the company of my colleagues.<br>
          - The excitement of test riding Zamperla rides every time the rides are ready for testing—I loved it.<br>
          - The humorous work immersion students that made me laugh almost every time they did something they made fun of.<br>
          </p><br>
        <p>
          My OJT at Zamperla Asia Pacific was an eye-opening experience that helped me develop technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and workplace adaptability. I am grateful to my supportive colleagues, especially my IT supervisor, who guided me throughout my training. This journey has strengthened my passion for IT and prepared me for future career opportunities.
          Overall, my time at Zamperla was not just about gaining experience but also about growing as a professional and enjoying the learning process along the way.
